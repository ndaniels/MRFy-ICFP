want to look at Age outside of mrfy in order to do SCIENCE!!!

  - not just implementing search; doing research on search algorithsm

  - therefore we want age to escape

  - accept function: every node has an infinite sequence of children,
    then you pick the first good one  (might need splittable random
    numbers and unsafe performio)

  - using gen0, you centralize the consumption of randomness


eliminate these stupid (Bool, Bool) argument to Viterbi


  possibility:  pass out *all* explored nodes with no age labels, tag
  accepted nodes
  *or* pass out only accepted nodes, tag each with age

  either way, age has to be used internally, because it's used to
  decide acceptance
