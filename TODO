I like CCost. At times i've referred to the total age of the search (or
simulation), which I think is NOT backwards. There is a duality between age of
the simulation and cost to reach a particular point. I think it is worth
mentioning this.

Sounds good.

You have the most LaTeX expertise; any suggestions?

"Age" is still an issue.  I don't remember seeing a reponse to my earlier
email on that one.  Please let me know what you think of CCost (cumulative
cost).   We can't use 'age'; that's backwards.

Also, the idea of "score" is introduced twice.   Perhaps these introductions
can be merged, and the negated log probability can be motivated more briefly,
where Score is defined?

Finally, in a 9pt font the paper must be formatted in block style.
The other style borders on unreadable.  At preset this will cost us
anotehr two column inches.

A diligent person would find a way to reduce the space around 
\smallverbatiminput{...} and \begin{smallverbatim}.  There's more
space there than we need...

Exactly. A lot of the tutorials I stumbled across personally focused
heavily on using QuickCheck and defining properties for types that
already implemented Arbitrary. There was usually only a smattering
about implementing Arbitrary for custom types. And at that point in
time (for me), working in the Gen monad was baffling.

This actually wasn't so bad. There were countless times when Noah and
I would stumble across an invariant in the initial design phase and
say, "Oh, that's definitely a QuickCheck property." We just blithely
skipped over the generator/shrinking part.

I do agree that it is an important piece of information to add to the
paper, though.

want to look at Age outside of mrfy in order to do SCIENCE!!!

  - not just implementing search; doing research on search algorithsm

  - therefore we want age to escape

  - accept function: every node has an infinite sequence of children,
    then you pick the first good one  (might need splittable random
    numbers and unsafe performio)

  - using gen0, you centralize the consumption of randomness


eliminate these stupid (Bool, Bool) argument to Viterbi


  possibility:  pass out *all* explored nodes with no age labels, tag
  accepted nodes
  *or* pass out only accepted nodes, tag each with age

  either way, age has to be used internally, because it's used to
  decide acceptance
